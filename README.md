# AntiCheat
This is a simple anticheat base I made for fun, after some playing around, I found out I was terrible at making anticheats, so I gave up, and just left it at the base with some example checks.

## Features
* Easy to use check system, with annotation-based ``CheckData``
* Some example checks.

# Note
I do not condone using this, it has not been thoroughly test, and I am not an experienced anticheat developer, it's just a simple fun project.
